How do I create a plugin ?

The easiest way to create a plugin is to implement the net.modera.shovel.resourceproviders.DiscoverableResourceProvider
interface and place it to your class-path, currently your class must resided in
net.modera.shovel.resourceprovider so the shovel would able to discover it. Also, 
do not forget to annotate your implementation with the org.springframework.stereotype.Component 
annotation because the Spring Autowiring facilities are used to load plugins dynamically.
